Problem Statement



Senthil is developing a text editor application and needs to implement a feature that allows users to insert a new character at a specified position in an array of characters. 



Write a program for him that takes input from the user and displays the updated array after the insertion.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the size of the array.

The second line contains n space-separated characters for the array.

The third line contains an integer m, representing the position(0-based) for insertion.

The fourth line contains a single character representing the new character to be inserted.

Output format :
The output should display the updated array after the insertion of the new element, separated by spaces.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 15

m < n

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
a b c d e
2
X
Output 1 :
a b X c d e
