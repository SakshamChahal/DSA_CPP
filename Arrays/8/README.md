Problem Statement



Assist Tamizh, a student who is learning about arrays. He came across a question that deletes the first element from an array. Since he is new to coding, he is unable to crack the logic. Help him with a program that should prompt the user to enter the elements and then display the updated array after deleting the first element.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the size of the array.

The second line of input contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

Output format :
The output displays the updated array after deleting the first element, separated by a space.



Refer to the sample output format for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 20

-100 ≤ elements of the array ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output 1 :
2 3 4 5 
Input 2 :
7
12 65 34 80 38 51 72
Output 2 :
65 34 80 38 51 72 
Input 3 :
5
8 -2 3 -4 6
Output 3 :
-2 3 -4 6
