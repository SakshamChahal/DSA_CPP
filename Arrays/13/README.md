Problem Statement



Sarath is developing a program that counts how many words in a list start with a specific letter. The program should take user input for the number of words, the words themselves, and the letter of interest. Finally, it should output the count of words that start with the given letter.



Write a program to help Sarath with this.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the number of words.

The next n lines each contain a single word (a string).

The last line contains a single character letter, the letter to check at the start of each word.

Output format :
The output prints a single integer representing the number of words that start with the specified letter.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 15

The length of each word should not exceed 100 characters.
