Problem Statement



Silvia needs to develop a program that calculates the sum of elements in an array. The program prompts the user to input the size of the array and its elements, computes the sum of all elements, and then displays the calculated sum.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of elements in the array.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

Output format :
The output prints the sum of the elements in the array.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 20

-100 ≤ elements of the array ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output 1 :
15
Input 2 :
7
12 65 34 80 38 51 72
Output 2 :
352
Input 3 :
5
8 -2 3 -4 6
Output 3 :
