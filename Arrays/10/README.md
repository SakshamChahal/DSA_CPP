Problem Statement



In a survey, a research company collected responses represented by integers. Due to multiple responses, some integers appear more frequently than others. Write a program that takes the number of responses and the responses themselves as input, then outputs the frequency of each unique response.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, which represents the number of responses.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers that represent the responses.

Output format :
The program outputs a series of lines, each representing the frequency of responses.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 25

1 ≤ responses ≤ 50

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
1 2 1 3 2
Output 1 :
1: 2
2: 2
3: 1
Input 2 :
6
4 2 4 4 6 2
Output 2 :
4: 3
2: 2
6: 1
