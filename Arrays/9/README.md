Problem Statement



Imagine you are developing a task management system for a team. One of the features requested by the team is the ability to remove the last task added to the list. Your task is to write a program that takes a list of task IDs and removes the last task from the list. After removing the last task, the program should display the updated list of tasks.

Input format :
The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of tasks in the list.

The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the task IDs.

Output format :
The output prints the updated list of tasks after removing the last task.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 15

1 ≤ task IDs ≤ 100
